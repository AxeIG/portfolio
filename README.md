Ratking is a stealth extraction game developed in Unity in 14 weeks for Abertay University's DES310 module, in collaboration with Modern Wolf. The project aimed to explore the extraction game genre, traditionally known for high-intensity, action-packed gameplay, by integrating a stealth-based approach instead. The player controls a rat sneaking through a mansion that belongs to a cat baron, stealing valuable goods in order to upgrade your base, all while avoiding the well-trained guards protecting the mansion. For this project I was responsible for creating the  AI and stealth mechanics.



### DirectX11 Scene

Grade Received: B+

A scene created in for my shaders module, utilising graphics techniques in order to create a sandy beach.

The coursework consists of a 3D scene created with DirectX shaders meant to showcase some key graphical techniques. The scene contains:
    An isolated mountain surrounded by water which where both created with use of vertex manipulation. The mountain is achieved with the use of heightmaps, the wave is created using Gerstner Waves 

    A rendered module representing a ship is placed on the beach and it reacts to two different light source that make the model cast shadows.

    A flying moveable UFO on the grassy plane that carries an object and acts as a spotlight towards the plane underneath it.
    
    Two brick-textured spheres meant to showcase point and specular light
    
    The application also has a bloom toggle as a post processing effect utilising gaussian blur.
    
    ImGui is included to allow manipulation of certain elements in the scene. The UI enables the user to edit the waveâ€™s properties, such as individual directions, wave length and steepness, manipulate light properties such as position and direction, and edit spotlight or specular attenuation factors. 




### OpenGL Scene

Grade Received: B+

A scene constructed using the OpenGL graphics API created for my Graphics Programming module. 
The scene consists of :
    Two rendered models that react to a spinning light source that cast shadows.
    
    A procedurally generated cylinder that holds a transparable case holding a rendered model. The display case spins around clockwise.
    
    A mirror that reflects the displayed model.
    
    A plane spinning around the scene holding an interchengable camera position

Grade: A+

[BoardGameArena link](https://tabletopia.com/games/enviorment-game-5tnj74/play-now)
(The board game is currently not published, but a play party can be set up with this link)
A board game made in Tabletopia, created for an Abertay Elective focused on expressing awareness on a topic of choice through the use of boardgames.
The game focuses on the effects of industrialism without enviorment consideration, focusing on the conflict and mistrust between the two sides.
There are two factions which compete against one another:
    A company which desires a fast expansion.
    A biodiversity organisation concerned regarding possible damages caused by the expansion

Both factions have a set of tokens they can use to gamble for tile slots on the map, all tokens are placed face down and are being revealed at the end stage of the game.


### DaciDava
![Dacidava Banner](/assets/img/Dacidava_Banner.jpg)

A patented strategy board inspired by games such as chess and GO I have designed with my father.
As a means to make strategy games more accessible DaciDava was created. The game expands on the GO mini-game Atari Go to make a completly fleshed out experience using the same core principles.

The game board is positioned between the two players. The color of the pieces is drawn.
Each player has 30 TOWERS and 7 CITADELS of the same color. The 7 CITADELS are arranged in the
predetermined places of the board (One KING, two CORNERS, two TRIPLE and two DOUBLE).
