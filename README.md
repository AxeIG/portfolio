Ratking is a stealth extraction game developed in Unity in 14 weeks for Abertay University's DES310 module, in collaboration with Modern Wolf. The project aimed to explore the extraction game genre, traditionally known for high-intensity, action-packed gameplay, by integrating a stealth-based approach instead. The player controls a rat sneaking through a mansion that belongs to a cat baron, stealing valuable goods in order to upgrade your base, all while avoiding the well-trained guards protecting the mansion. For this project I was responsible for designing the  AI and stealth mechanics.
